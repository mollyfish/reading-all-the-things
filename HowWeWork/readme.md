#Notes on *How We Work* (http://markboulton.co.uk/journal/how-we-work)

This piece was a very short summary of how a design company manages their projects.  The author, Mark Boulton, walks through the timeline of a project, and addresses some of the challenges and advantages of using an Agile-style process.

The project begins with a lot of up-front work with the client, to address their needs (stated and not), the timing, and the scope of the project.  Mark offers some tips on what to look for, like trying to identify the influential members of the client group and getting them on your side.  He also warns that training a client in how the design company works can be a lot of work.

The project advances in "sprints," which are aimed at creating output - which isn't always code or a new visual.  Sometimes it's research results, but research is front-loaded into the beginning of the project.  

Sprints are not aimed at accomplishing specific tasks in a specific amount of time; Mark says that that approach just doesn't work for them (the little experience I have matches this opinion!).

He also says that they do not use retrospectives, since their office is very good at communications.  I think this is a wise choice, given the situation in their office, but if there was less day-to-day checking-in, I think a chance for everyone to review what's happened, what's happening next, *etc*, would be very useful.
